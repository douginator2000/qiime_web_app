    If you haven't started keeping a food diary, that's a great place to start!<br /> You'll need dietary information 
    for at least 7 days before you can add a participant and fill out the survey. <br /><br />
    There are a number of FREE online dietary tools out there â€“ we recommend <a href="http://www.fitday.com/" target="_blank" class="help">FitDay</a> and 
    <a href="http://caloriecount.about.com/" target="_blank" class="help">Calorie Count</a>. 
    Note we will be asking questions about your carb, protein, fat, alcohol, and fiber intake, 
    (as a percentage of your total intake) as well as some info on types of food. So, use a tool 
    that allows you to enter as much detail as possible.
